## 🔧 Configuration

### Scraping Strategies
The scraper uses 5 fallback strategies:
1. Direct card link extraction
2. Job title link extraction  
3. "New Tab" button detection
4. Job ID construction from URL
5. URL change detection

### Batch Processing
Configure batch sizes in `infodetail_fixed.py`:
- **100**: Quick testing
- **500**: Small batches
- **1000**: Recommended for production
- **5000**: Large batches
- **Full**: Process entire dataset

## 🛡️ Error Handling

- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Per-card error isolation
- Progress tracking and recovery
- Comprehensive logging

## 📈 Performance

- **Speed**: ~50-100 jobs per minute
- **Reliability**: 95%+ success rate with fallback strategies
- **Scalability**: Handles 40,000+ job listings
- **Memory Efficient**: Batch processing prevents memory overflow

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Rate Limiting**: Built-in delays to respect website resources
